           This past year, we've definitely discovered new ways to enjoy (or survive) staying inside. Complicated puzzles littered our kitchen tables and we found unique ways to entertain ourself, amongst many other creative ways we passed the time indoors. But the bright spot of this pandemic has been the outdoors and nature. With a mask and a little social distancing, many of us kept our sanity only in part because we were able to log off at the end of the day and escape to the trail or the beach, or even just to our neighborhood sidewalks. In the same way, these 58 quotes highlight the wonder and beauty found in nature, we've also found that as time slows down we've started noticing the trees and plants in our own yards as they change through the seasons. We were once too busy to notice the falling leaves or the budding wildflowers, but now we see even the smallest of changes as they happen and enjoy each breath we take of fresh air.
